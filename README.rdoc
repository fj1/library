***** DataBeast *****

DataBeast is a demo web application, and is one of my senior projects for MakerSquare. It is designed for a user to manage their personal library of books, CDs, DVDs, and video games. 

It is a basic CRUD application built with:
• Ruby, Rails
• JavaScript, jQuery
• HTML, CSS, Foundation
• DataTables, a JavaScript/jQuery plug-in: www.datatables.net
